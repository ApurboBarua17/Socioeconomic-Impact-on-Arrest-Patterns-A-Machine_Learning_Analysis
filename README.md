Socioeconomic Impact on Arrest Patterns: A Machine Learning Analysis


Overview

This project applies machine learning and statistical analysis to investigate the relationship between socioeconomic factors and arrest patterns. Using datasets containing income levels and arrest records, we identify disparities and assess predictive models to understand systemic biases in law enforcement.

Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and normalizes features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes arrest trends using heatmaps, bar charts, and correlation matrices.

Machine Learning Models: Implements Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and other classifiers to predict arrest likelihood.

Feature Engineering: Generates custom socio-economic features to improve model accuracy.

Statistical Analysis: Uses Chi-Squared tests to validate disparities in arrest rates.

Technologies Used

Programming Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels

Tools: Jupyter Notebook
